          <p>This scheme is a modification of the previous one. A restriction is imposed on teh fill words so that each fill word can be turned into integer number of literal words. We see this as the essence of the alignment requirement. In the previous section, we reviewed three byte-aligned schemes. In each case, a fill is required to be multiple bytes in length. A naive definition of word-alignment may be taken as the fill seizes have to be integer number of words. Using a word contains 32 bits as example, we may require all fill words to represent multiple of 32 bits. Since each literal HRL word contains 32 useful bits, this causes bitwise logical operations between a fill word and a literal word to leave off an arbitrary number of excess bits. This will lead to the same problem that slows down the HRL scheme. To avoid this problem, all fill words need to have multiple of 31 bits. We call the HRL, scheme with this extra requirement the <b>word-aligned hybrid run-length code</b>, or WAH for short</p>
