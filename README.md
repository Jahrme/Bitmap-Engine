# Bitmap Engine
Bitmap indexing is a database implementation system known for its highly efficient queries. This engine implements bitmap compression and querying using several different techniques.

## Getting started
Clone the repository and make sure you're at the top level of `BitmapEngine/`.

Compile all files and run test files:
```
make
```
Test unstriped compression:
```
make compress_u
```
Test striped compression:
```
make compress_s
```
